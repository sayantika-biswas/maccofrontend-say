        question: 'How do native and hybrid apps differ from each other?',
        answer: ' Native apps are developed specifically for one platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android). They offer optimal performance and access to all device features.  Hybrid apps are built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and run inside a native container. They can be deployed across multiple platforms but might not perform as well as native apps.'
